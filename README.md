I learned that the best format for a border is:
border: 5px solid red;
Merely setting border-width and border-color won't make a border appear. There HAS to be a style, too, so the condensed version is best.

I suspect I need to do a better job of conceptually working out beforehand which things need classes and which need IDs.

I'm a little surprised that the Odin Project didn't cover file managment yet (i.e. doing css in a separate file rather than in <style> tags in the same file).
